## Continue on Robust Fitting of parametric models

### RANSAC

#### Definition: RANdom SAmple Consensus

RANSAC is a method to fit a model to a set of data points.

It is a non-deterministic algorithm that can be used to fit a model to a set of data points.

Pros:

- Simple and general 
- Applicable to many different problems
- Often works well in practice

Cons:

- Lots of parameters to set
- Number of iterations grows exponentially as outlier ratio increases
- Can't always get a good initialization of the model based on the minimum number of samples.

### Hough Transform

Use point-line duality to find lines.

In practice, we don't use (m,b) parameterization.

Instead, we use polar parameterization:

$$
\rho = x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta
$$

Algorithm outline:

- Initialize accumulator $H$ to all zeros
  - For each feature point $(x,y)$
    - For $\theta = 0$ to $180$
    - $\rho = x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta$
    - $H(\theta, \rho) += 1$
- Find the value(s) of $(\theta, \rho)$ where $H(\theta, \rho)$ is a local maximum (perform NMS on the accumulator array)
  - The detected line in the image is given by $\rho = x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta$

#### Effect of noise

Noise makes the peak fuzzy.

#### Effect of outliers

Outliers can break the peak.

#### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Can deal with non-locality and occlusion
- Can detect multiple instances of a model
- Some robustness to noise: noise points unlikely to contribute consistently to any single bin
- Leads to a surprisingly general strategy for shape localization (more on this next)

Cons:

- Complexity increases exponentially with the number of model parameters 
  - In practice, not used beyond three or four dimensions
- Non-target shapes can produce spurious peaks in parameter space
- It's hard to pick a good grid size

### Generalize Hough Transform

Template representation: for each type of landmark point, store all possible displacement vectors towards the center

Detecting the template:

For each feature in a new image, look up that feature type in the model and vote for the possible center locations associated with that type in the model

#### Implicit shape models

Training:

- Build codebook of patches around extracted interest points using clustering
- Map the patch around each interest point to closest codebook entry
- For each codebook entry, store all positions it was found, relative to object center

Testing:

- Given test image, extract patches, match to codebook entry 
- Cast votes for possible positions of object center
- Search for maxima in voting space
- Extract weighted segmentation mask based on stored masks for the codebook occurrences

## Image alignment

### Affine transformation

Simple fitting procedure: linear least squares
Approximates viewpoint changes for roughly planar objects and roughly orthographic cameras
Can be used to initialize fitting for more complex models

Fitting an affine transformation:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
&&&\cdots\\
x_i & y_i & 0&0&1&0\\
0&0&x_i&y_i&0&1\\
&&&\cdots\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
m_1\\
m_2\\
m_3\\
m_4\\
t_1\\
t_2\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cdots\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Only need 3 points to solve for 6 parameters.

### Homography

Recall that

$$
x' = \frac{a x + b y + c}{g x + h y + i}, \quad y' = \frac{d x + e y + f}{g x + h y + i}
$$

Use 2D homogeneous coordinates:

$(x,y) \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$

$\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\w\end{pmatrix} \rightarrow (x/w,y/w)$

Reminder: all homogeneous coordinate vectors that are (non-zero) scalar multiples of each other represent the same point


Equation for homography in homogeneous coordinates:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\cong
\begin{pmatrix}
h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13} \\
h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23} \\
h_{31} & h_{32} & h_{33}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Constraint from a match $(x_i,x_i^′)$: $x_i^′≅Hx_i$

How can we get rid of the scale ambiguity? 

Cross product trick:	$x_i^′ × Hx_i=0$

The cross product is defined as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}a'\\b'\\c'\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}bc'-b'c\\ca'-c'a\\ab'-a'b\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let $h_1^T, h_2^T, h_3^T$ be the rows of $H$. Then

$$
x_i^′ × Hx_i=\begin{pmatrix}
    x_i^′ \\
    y_i^′ \\
    1
\end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}
    h_1^T x_i \\
    h_2^T x_i \\
    h_3^T x_i
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    y_i^′ h_3^T x_i−h_2^T x_i \\
    h_1^T x_i−x_i^′ h_3^T x_i \\
    x_i^′ h_2^T x_i−y_i^′ h_1^T x_i
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Constraint from a match $(x_i,x_i^′)$:

$$
x_i^′ × Hx_i=\begin{pmatrix}
    x_i^′ \\
    y_i^′ \\
    1
\end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}
    h_1^T x_i \\
    h_2^T x_i \\
    h_3^T x_i
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    y_i^′ h_3^T x_i−h_2^T x_i \\
    h_1^T x_i−x_i^′ h_3^T x_i \\
    x_i^′ h_2^T x_i−y_i^′ h_1^T x_i
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Rearranging the terms:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    0^T &-x_i^T &y_i^′ x_i^T \\
    x_i^T &0^T &-x_i^′ x_i^T \\
    y_i^′ x_i^T &x_i^′ x_i^T &0^T
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    h_1 \\
    h_2 \\
    h_3
\end{bmatrix} = 0
$$

These equations aren't independent! So, we only need two.

### Robust alignment

#### Descriptor-based feature matching

Extract features
Compute putative matches
Loop:

- Hypothesize transformation $T$
- Verify transformation (search for other matches consistent with $T$)

#### RANSAC

Even after filtering out ambiguous matches, the set of putative matches still contains a very high percentage of outliers

RANSAC loop:

- Randomly select a seed group of matches
- Compute transformation from seed group
- Find inliers to this transformation 
- If the number of inliers is sufficiently large, re-compute least-squares estimate of transformation on all of the inliers

At the end, keep the transformation with the largest number of inliers

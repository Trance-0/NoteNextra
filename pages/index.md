# Welcome to NoteNextra
 
This was originated from another project [NoteChondria](https://github.com/Trance-0/Notechondria) that I've been working on for a long time but don't have a stable release yet.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish it at any time soon. And I've got a lot of materials to share with you guys.

So here it is. A lite server for you to read my notes.

**Remember, I take notes don't means that I like them and paying attention to the lecture.**

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold">It's because I'm too easy to fall asleep if I stop doing something on my hand when my mind is wandering.</p>

So I'm not responsible for any wrong notes or facts recorded in my notes since I rarely check them and use them as a reference. I'd like to read the book which have been proof read by many pQEDle.

If you find any mistakes, please let me know by submitting an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Trance-0/NoteNextra). Or click the `Edit this page` button at the side of the page to fix it yourself with appropriate push request. I really appreciate and willing to accept any valuable contribution in this project.

Enjoy!

## Continue on the "small set"

### Cantor set

#### Theorem: Cantor set is perfect, nowhere dense

Proved last lecture.

_Other construction of the set by removing the middle non-zero interval $(\frac{1}{n},n>0)$ and take the intersection of all such steps is called $SVC(n)$_

Back to $\frac{1}{3}$ Cantor set.

Every step we delete $\frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n}$ of the total "content".

Thus, the total length removed after infinitely many steps is:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n} = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n=1
$$

However, the quarter cantor set removes $\frac{3^{n-1}}{4^n}$ of the total "content", and the total length removed after infinitely many steps is:

_skip this part, some error occurred._

#### Monotonicity of outer content

If $S\subseteq T$, then $c_e(S)\leq c_e(T)$.

Proof: 

If $C$ is cover of $T$, then $S\subseteq T\subseteq C$, so $C$ is a cover of $S$. Since $c_e(s)$ takes the inf over a larger set that $c_e(T)$, $c_e(S) \leq c_e(T)$.

QED

#### Theorem Osgorod's Lemma

If $S$ is closed and bounded, then

$$
\lim_{k\to \infty} c_e(S_k)=c_e(S)
$$

# CSE 347

This is a course about fancy algorithms.

Topics include:

1. Greedy Algorithms
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Divide and Conquer
4. Maximum Flows
5. Reductions
6. NP-Complete Problems
7. Approximation Algorithms
8. Randomized Algorithms
9. Online Algorithms

It's hard if you don't know the tricks for solving leetcode problems.

I've been doing leetcode daily problems for almost 2 years when I get into the course.

It's relatively easy for me but I do have a hard time to get every proof right.

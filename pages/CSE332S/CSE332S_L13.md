# CSE332S Lecture 13

## Copy control

Copy control consists of 5 distinct operations 

- A `copy constructor` initializes an object by duplicating the const l-value that was passed to it by reference
- A `copy-assignment operator` (re)sets an object's value by duplicating the const l-value passed to it by reference
- A `destructor` manages the destruction of an object
- A `move constructor` initializes an object by transferring the implementation from the r-value reference passed to it (next lecture)
- A `move-assignment operator` (re)sets an object's value by transferring the implementation from the r-value reference passed to it (next lecture)

Today we'll focus on the first 3 operations and will defer the others (introduced in C++11) until next time

- The others depend on the new C++11 `move semantics`

### Basic copy control operations

A copy constructor or copy-assignment operator takes a reference to a (usually const) instance of the class

- Copy constructor initializes a new object from it
- Copy-assignment operator sets object's value from it
- In either case, original the object is left unchanged (which differs from the move versions of these operations)
- Destructor takes no arguments `~A()` (except implicit `this`)

Copy control operations for built-in types

- Copy construction and copy-assignment copy values
- Destructor of built-in types does nothing (is a "no-op")

Compiler-synthesized copy control operations

- Just call that same operation on each member of the object
- Uses defined/synthesized definition of that operation for user-defined types (see above for built-in types)

### Preventing or Allowing Basic Copy Control

Old (C++03) way to prevent compiler from generating a default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, or assignment operator was somewhat awkward

- Declare private, don't define, don't use within class
- This works, but gives cryptic linker error if operation is used

New (C++11) way to prevent calls to any method

- End the declaration with `= delete` (and don't define)
- Compiler will then give an intelligible error if a call is made

C++11 allows a constructor to call peer constructors

- Allows re-use of implementation (through delegation)
- Object is fully constructed once any constructor finishes

C++11 lets you ask compiler to synthesize operations

- Explicitly, but only for basic copy control, default constructor
- End the declaration with `= default` (and don't define) The compiler will then generate the operation or throw an error if it can't.

## Shallow vs Deep Copy

### Shallow Copy Construction

```cpp
// just uses the array that's already in the other object
IntArray::IntArray(const IntArray &a)
  :size_(a.size_), 
   values_(a.values_) {
    // only memory address is copied, not the memory it points to
}

int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
   IntArray arr = {0,1,2};
   IntArray arr2 = arr;
   return 0;
}
```

There are two ways to "copy"

- Shallow: re-aliases existing resources
  - E.g., by copying the address value from a pointer member variable
- Deep: makes a complete and separate copy
  - I.e., by following pointers and deep copying what they alias

Version above shows shallow copy

- Efficient but may be risky (why?) The destructor will delete the memory that the other object is pointing to.
- Usually want no-op destructor, aliasing via `shared_ptr` or a boolean value to check if the object is the original memory allocator for the resource.

### Deep Copy Construction

```cpp
IntArray::IntArray(const IntArray &a)
  :size_(0), values_(nullptr) {

  if (a.size_ > 0) {
    // new may throw bad_alloc, 
    // set size_ after it succeeds 
    values_ = new int[a.size_];
    size_ = a.size_;

    // could use memcpy instead   
    for (size_t i = 0; 
         i < size_; ++i) {
      values_[i] = a.values_[i];
    }
  }
}
int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
   IntArray arr = {0,1,2};
   IntArray arr2 = arr;
   return 0;
}

```

This code shows deep copy

- Safe: no shared aliasing, exception aware initialization
- But may not be as efficient as shallow copy in many cases

Note trade-offs with arrays

- Allocate memory once
- More efficient than multiple calls to new (heap search)
- Constructor and assignment called on each array element
- Less efficient than block copy
  - E.g., using `memcpy()`
- But sometimes necessary
  - i.e., constructors, destructors establish needed invariants

Each object is responsible for its own resources.

## Swap Trick for Copy-Assignment

The swap trick is a way to implement the copy-assignment operator, given that the `size_` and `values_` members are already defined in constructor.

```cpp
class Array {
public:
    Array(unsigned int) ; // assume constructor allocates memory
    Array(const Array &); // assume copy constructor makes a deep copy
    ~Array(); // assume destructor calls delete on values_
    Array & operator=(const Array &a);
private:
    size_t size_;
    int * values_;
};

Array & Array::operator=(const Array &a) { // return ref lets us chain
    if (&a != this) { // note test for self-assignment (safe, efficient)
        Array temp(a);  // copy constructor makes deep copy of a
        swap(temp.size_, size_);     // note unqualified calls to swap
        swap(temp.values_, values_); // (do user-defined or std::swap) 
    }
    return *this; // previous *values_ cleaned up by temp's destructor, which is the member variable of the current object
}

int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
    IntArray arr = {0,1,2};
    IntArray arr2 = {3,4,5};
    arr2 = arr;
    return 0;
}

```

## Review: Construction/destruction order with inheritance, copy control with inheritance

### Constructor and Destructor are Inverses

```cpp
IntArray::IntArray(unsigned int u)
 : size_(0), values_(nullptr) {
  // exception safe semantics
  values_ = new int [u]; 
  size_ = u;
}

IntArray::~IntArray() {

  // deallocates heap memory 
  // that values_ points to,
  // so it's not leaked:
  // with deep copy, object
  // owns the memory
  delete [] values_;

  // the size_ and values_
  // member variables are
  // themselves destroyed
  // after destructor body
}
```
Constructors initialize

- At the start of each object's lifetime
- Implicitly called when object is created

Destructors clean up

- Implicitly called when  an object is destroyed
  - E.g., when stack frame where it was declared goes out of scope
  - E.g., when its address is passed to delete
  - E.g., when another object of which it is a member is being destroyed

### More on Initialization and Destruction

Initialization follows a well defined order

- Base class constructor is called
  - That constructor recursively follows this order, too
- Member constructors are called
  - In order members were declared
  - Good style to list in that order (a good compiler may warn if not)
- Constructor body is run

Destruction occurs in the reverse order

- Destructor body is run, then member destructors, then base class destructor (which recursively follows reverse order)

**Make destructor virtual if members are virtual**

- Or if class is part of an inheritance hierarchy
- Avoids “slicing”: ensures destruction starts at the most derived class destructor (not at some higher base class)

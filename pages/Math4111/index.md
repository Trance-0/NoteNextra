# Math 4111

This is a course about real analysis.

Topics include:

1. Number Theory
2. Basic topology and set theory
3. Sequences and Series
4. Convergence of Series and Sequences
5. Limits and Continuity

The course is taught by [Alan Chang](https://math.wustl.edu/people/alan-chang).

It is easy in my semester perhaps, it is the first course I got 3 perfect scores in exams. (Unfortunately, I did not get the extra credit for the third midterm exam.)

## Midterms stats

Our semester is way more easier than the previous ones. The previous ones got median scores of 25.

Stats for first midterm:

| |out of|avg|stddev|25th|50th|75th|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|total|50|40.7|9.9|37.0|45.0|48.0|
|1a|10|9.3|2.0|10.0|10.0|10.0|
|1b|10|8.3|2.4|6.8|9.0|10.0|
|2a|10|7.5|3.1|6.0|8.0|10.0|
|2b|10|6.9|3.4|4.0|8.0|10.0|
|3|10|8.8|2.4|9.0|10.0|10.0|

I skipped the last half hour, still get 50. I can't believe how easy it is compared to homework assignments.


Stats for second midterm:

| |out of|avg|stddev|25th|50th|75th|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|total|50.0|37.3|12.4|30.5|41.0|47.5|
|1|10|7.6|3.2|4.0|10.0|10.0|
|2|10|8.9|2.7|10.0|10.0|10.0|
|3|10|6.6|3.4|4.0|8.0|10.0|
|4a|10|6.6|4.1|2.0|9.0|10.0|
|4b|10|7.7|3.5|8.0|10.0|10.0|

I skipped the last half hour again, still get 50. But I felt this time is more challenging than the first one. Much like what Math is.

Stats for third midterm:

| |out of|avg|stddev|25th|50th|75th|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|total|50.0|37.2|10.1|31.0|40.0|44.8|
|1|10|8.2|3.1|7.0|10.0|10.0|
|2|10|8.2|2.5|7.0|10.0|10.0|
|3|10|7.1|3.0|6.0|6.0|10.0|
|4a|10|5.6|4.2|0.0|6.5|9.8|
|4b|10|8.1|3.4|6.5|10.0|10.0|
|5|0|0.0|0.1|0.0|0.0|0.0|

I got 50 and just barely made it. The third midterm is the hardest one. The extra credit question is way too hard and I only got few minutes to solve it.-->

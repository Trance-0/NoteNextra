# Math 401, Topic 6: Postulates of quantum theory and measurement operations

## Section 1: Postulates of quantum theory

This part is a review of the quantum theory, I will keep the content brief.

If you are familiar with the linear algebra defined before, you can jump right into this section to keep your time as viewing those compact notations.

### Pure states

### Composite systems

### Mixed states and density operators

### Density operator of subsystems

### State purification

### Observables

### Effects and Busch's theorem for effect operators

### Measurements

### Quantum operations and CPTP maps

### Conditional operations

## Section 2: Quantum entanglement

### Bell states and the EPR phenomenon

### Von Neumann entropy and maximally entangled states

## Section 3: Information transmission by quantum systems

### Transmission of classical information

### Making use of entanglement and local operations

### Superdense coding [very important]

## Section 4: Quantum automorphisms and dynamics

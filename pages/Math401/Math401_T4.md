# Topic 4: The quantum version of probabilistic concepts

> In mathematics, on often speaks of non-commutative instead of quantum constructions.

## Section 1: Generalities about classical versus quantum systems

In classical physics, we assume that a systema's properties have well-defined values regardless of how we choose to measure them.

### Basic terminology

#### Observables

#### Set of states

The preparation of a system builds a convex set of states as our initial condition for the system. 

For a collection of $N$ system. Let procedure $N_1=\lambda P_1$ be a preparation procedure for state $P_1$, and $N_2=(1-\lambda) P_2$ be a preparation procedure for state $P_2$. The state of the collection is $N=\lambda N_1+(1-\lambda) N_2$.

#### Set of effects

The set of effects is the set of all possible outcomes of a measurement. $\Omega=\{\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_n\}$. Where each $\omega_i$ is an associated effect, or some query problems regarding the system. (For example, is outcome $\omega_i$ observed?)

#### Registration of outcomes

A pair of state and effect determines a probability $E_i(P)=p(\omega_i|P)$. By the law of large numbers, this probability shall converge to $N(\omega_i)/N$ as $N$ increases.

**Quantum states, observables, and effects can be represented mathematically by linear operators on a Hilbert space.**

## Section 2: Examples of physical experiment in language of mathematics

### Sten-Gernach experiment

**State preparation:** Silver tams are emitted from a thermal source and collimated to form a beam.

**Measurement:** Silver atoms interact with the field produced by the magnet and impinges on the class plate.

**Registration:** The impression left on the glass pace by the condensed silver atoms.

## Finite probability spaces in the language of Hilbert space and operators

> Superposition is a linear combination of two or more states.

A quantum coin can be represented mathematically by linear combination of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.$\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle\in\mathscr{H}\cong\mathbb{C}^2$.

> For the rest of the material, we shall take the $\mathscr{H}$ to be vector space over $\mathbb{C}$.

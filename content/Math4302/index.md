There will be weekly homework. The homework is due on Friday (starting from January 23 ) via Gradescope. The Homework questions will be chosen from the textbook.

Late homework will not be accepted.

You are encouraged to discuss the problems with other students, but the write-up must be your own. Adherence to the university's academic integrity policy Links to an external site.is expected and required.

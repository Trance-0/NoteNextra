Homework

You will have graded homework turned in every Tuesday by 18:00, (6:00 p.m).  Late homework will not be accepted! The homework collected is to be considered a bare minimum of homework that you should do. **"A" students will generally do nearly every problem in the exercise sections.**

We will use an online system called Gradescope to collect and distribute homework, which you can sign in with your Canvas account. Only PDF and JPEG format files will be accepted by Gradescope. You will need to upload your work for each problem separately. Simply drag and drop your files to the upload areas under the questions or browse to locate them. You can drag between questions, and add or delete pages under each question. Please make sure your pictures are sharp enough to be graded. And please ensure the uploaded pages are in order and rotated correctly if  your solution is written on several pages.

Homework is graded according to the following distribution. Each homework set consists of 5 problems. Each problem counts for 10 points and the total score of a homework  is 50 points. 
Grading scale

Homework: 50%, Midterm: 25%, Final: 25%. The grades are assigned according the percentage you are in the class.

You are expected to take the exams at their scheduled times. If you are away because of a  university sporting event or field trip, then you may arrange for your coach or professor to administer the exam. Excused absences may be granted in the case of illness or bereavement. All excused absences must be granted before the exam is taken. The final exam date cannot be changed for reasons of traveling convenience.

In total, we will collect 10 homework sets. You are allowed to drop the two lowest homework scores.

You are allowed to discuss with your classmates, friends, and artificial intelligence applications to work on your homework problems. Please make sure that you are writing the final solutions independently. Proper acknowledgements of your discussion with various resources should be stated in your homework solutions. 

Letter grades will be given based on your overall score. The cutoffs for the various letter grades will be no higher than the following:

| Letter | Score |
|:------:|:-----:|
| A-| 85|
| B-| 75|
| C-|60|
|D|50|

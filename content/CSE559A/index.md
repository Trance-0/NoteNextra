## Grading

### Homework

Homework consists of ~7 programming assignments in Python, focused on implementing core algorithms. Most include auto-graded components. Two late days allowed per assignment; after that, the score is zero. No late submissions for quizzes, paper reviews, or project.

### Exams / Quizzes

There are ~5 quizzes covering lectures and readings. They include both theoretical and applied questions. No late quizzes.

### Paper Reviews

Four short reviews of recent computer vision research papers. Includes an in-class discussion component.

### Project

An individual or small-team project implementing, evaluating, or developing a vision method. Specifications on Canvas.

## Technology Requirements

Assignments may require GPU access (e.g., Google Colab, Academic Jupyter). Students must avoid modifying starter code in ways that break auto-grading.

## Collaboration & Materials Policy

Discussion is allowed, but all submitted work (code, written content, reports) must be individual. Posting assignment solutions publicly is prohibited. Automated plagiarism detection (e.g., Turnitin) may be used.

## Generative AI Policy

* **Homework & Projects:** Allowed with limitations; students must understand all algorithms used.
* **Quizzes:** May be used for explanation but not direct answering.
* **Reports:** AI-assisted writing permitted with responsibility for correctness.

More detailed rules are on Canvas.

## University Policies

### Recording Policy

Classroom activities and materials may not be recorded or distributed without explicit authorization.

### COVID-19 Guidelines

Students with symptoms must contact Student Health for testing. Masking policies may change depending on conditions.

If you'd like, I can also produce:

* a **cleaned, typographically polished** version
* a **PDF** or **GitHub-ready README.md**
* a version styled identically to your department’s standard syllabus format

# CSE510 Deep Reinforcement Learning (Lecture 17)

## Model-based RL

### Model-based RL vs. Model-free RL

- Sample efficiency
- Generalization and transferability
- Support efficient exploration in large-scale RL problems
- Explainability
- Super-human performance in practice

### Deterministic Environment: Cross-Entropy Method

#### Stochastic Optimization

abstract away optimal control/planning:

$$
a_1,\ldots, a_T =\argmax_{a_1,\ldots, a_T} J(a_1,\ldots, a_T)
$$

$$
A=\argmax_{A} J(A)
$$

Simplest method: guess and check: "random shooting method"

- pick $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ from some distribution (e.g. uniform)
- Choose $A_i$ based on $\argmax_i J(A_i)$

#### Cross-Entropy Method with continuous-valued inputs

1. sample $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ from some distribution $p(A)$
2. evaluate $J(A_1), J(A_2), ..., J(A_n)$
3. pick the _elites_ $A_1, A_2, ..., A_m$ with the highest $J(A_i)$, where $m<n$
4. update the distribution $p(A)$ to be more likely to choose the elites

Pros:

- Very fast to run if parallelized
- Extremely simple to implement

Cons:

- Very harsh dimensionality limit
- Only open-loop planning
- Suboptimal in stochastic environments

### Discrete Case: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Discrete planning as a search problem

Close-loop planning:

- At each state, iteratively build a search tree to evaluate actions, select the best-first action, and the move the next state.



#### Continuous Case: Trajectory Optimization

#### Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)

#### Non-linear iterative LQR (iLQR)/ Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)

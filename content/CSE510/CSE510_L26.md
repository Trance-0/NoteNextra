# CSE510 Deep Reinforcement Learning (Lecture 26)

## Continue on Real-World Practical Challenges for RL

### Factored multi-agent RL

- Sample efficiency -> Shared Learning
- Complexity -> High-Order Factorization
- Partial Observability -> Communication Learning
- Sparse reward -> Coordinated Exploration

#### Parameter Sharing vs. Diversity

- Parameter Sharing is critical for deep MARL methods
- However, agents tend to acquire homogenous behaviors
- Diversity is essential for exploration and practical tasks

Schematics of Our Approach: Celebrating Diversity in Shared MARL (CDS)

- In representation, CDS allows MARL to adaptively decide
when to share learning
- Encouraging Diversity in Optimization

In optimization, maximizing an information-theoretic objective to achieve identity-aware diversity

$$
\begin{aligned}
I^\pi(\tau_T;id)&=H(\tau_t)-H(\tau_T|id)=\mathbbb{E}_{id,\tau_T\sim \pi}\left[\log \frac{p(\tau_T|id)}{p(\tau_T)}\right]\\
&= \mathbb{E}_{id,\tau}\left[ \log \frac{p(o_0|id)}{p(o_0)}+\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\log\frac{a_t|\tau_t,id}{p(a_t|\tau_t)}+\log \frac{p(o_{t+1}|\tau_t,a_t,id)}{p(o_{t+1}|\tau_t,a_t)}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Here: $\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\log\frac{a_t|\tau_t,id}{p(a_t|\tau_t)}$ represents the action diversity.

$\log \frac{p(o_{t+1}|\tau_t,a_t,id)}{p(o_{t+1}|\tau_t,a_t)}$ represents the observation diversity.

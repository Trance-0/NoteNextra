# CSE4303 Introduction to Computer Security (Lecture 4)

## Network attacks

### Examining the transport layer

#### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Connection-oriented, preserves order

- Sender
  - Break data into packets
  - Attach packet numbers
- Receiver
  - Acknowledge receipt; lost packets are resent
  - Reassemble packets in correct order

#### Security Problems

1. Network packets pass by untrusted hosts
   - Eavesdropping, packet sniffing
   - Especially easy when attacker controls a machine close to victim (e.g. WiFi routers)
2. TCP state easily obtained by eavesdropping
   - Enables spoofing and session hijacking
3. Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities

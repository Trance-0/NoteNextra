# CSE5313 Final Project

## Description

Write a report which presents the paper in detail and criticizes it constructively. Below are some suggestions to guide a proper analysis of the paper:

- What is the problem setting? What is the motivation behind this problem?
- Which tools are being used? How are these tools related to the topics we have seen in class/HW?
- Is the paper technically sound, easy to read, and does the problem make sense?
- Are there any issues with the paper? If so, suggest ways these could be fixed.
- What is the state of the art in this topic? Were there any major follow-up works? What are major open problems or new directions?
- Suggest directions for further study and discuss how should those be addressed.

Please typeset your work using a program such as Word or LaTeX, and submit via Gradescope by Dec. 10th (EOD).

Reports will be judged by the depth and breadth of the analysis. Special attention will be given to clarity and organization, including proper abstract, introduction, sections, and citation of previous works.

There is no page limit, but good reports should contain 4-6 single-column pages.
Please refer to the syllabus for our policy regarding the use of GenAI.

## Paper selection

[Good quantum error-correcting codes exist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9512032)

> [!TIP]
>
> I will build the self-contained report that is readable for me 7 months ago, assuming no knowledge in quantum computing and quantum information theory.
>
> We will use notation defined in class and $[n]=\{1,\cdots,n-1,n\}$, (yes, we use 1 indexed in computer science) each in natural number. And $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This notation system is annoying since in mathematics, $A^*$ is the transpose of $A$, but since we are using literatures in physics, we keep the notation of $A^*$. In this report, I will try to make the notation consistent as possible and follows the **physics** convention in this report. So every vector you see will be in $\ket{\psi}$ form. And we will avoid using the $\langle v,w\rangle$ notation for inner product as it used in math, we will use $\langle v|w\rangle$ or $\langle v,w\rangle$ to denote the inner product.

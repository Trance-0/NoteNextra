## Overview

Coding/information theory emerged in the mid-20th century as a mathematical theory of communication with noise. In recent decades, it has become a vast topic encompassing most aspects of handling large datasets. The course will begin with the classical mathematical theory and its basic communication applications, then continue to contemporary applications in storage, computation, privacy, machine learning, and emerging technologies such as networks, blockchains, and DNA storage.

## Course Grade

The final grade (0–100) will be determined as follows:

- Homework assignments: **50%**
- Midterm: **25%**
- Final assignment: **25%**

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following table:

|  Letter  |    Range    |  Letter  |    Range    |  Letter  |    Range     |  Letter  |    Range      |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|    A     | [94, 100]   |   B−     | [80, 84)    |   D+     | [67, 70)     |    D     | [64, 67)      |
|   A−     | [90, 94)    |   C+     | [77, 80)    |    D−    | [61, 64)     |    F     | (−∞, 61)      |
|   B+     | [87, 90)    |    C     | [74, 77)    |          |              |          |               |
|    B     | [84, 87)    |   C−     | [70, 74)    |          |              |          |               |

### Appeals

- Appeals must be submitted through Gradescope within 7 days of work being returned
- Provide a detailed explanation supporting your appeal

---

## Late Days

- Each student has a budget of **five late days** for homework submissions
- Assignments are due by **8:59pm CDT** on the due date
- Any part of a late day counts as a full late day
- No more than two late days can be used for any one homework
- You are responsible for tracking your late-day usage
- After using all late days, homework can only be late for medical or family emergencies

---

## Collaboration and Academic Integrity

- Discuss problems with peers, but write your solutions **on your own**
- List all students you discussed each problem with and any significant external sources used in your submission
- Lack of necessary citations is a violation of policy
- **You may not use any solution keys, guides, or solutions** from previous classes, similar courses, or textbooks, however obtained
- No collaboration is allowed during exams
- Violations may result in failing the class and formal academic integrity proceedings

---

### Clarification Regarding Generative AI Tools

- The use of generative artificial intelligence tools (GenAI) is permitted **with restrictions**
    - Do **not** ask GenAI for complete solutions
    - Permitted uses: 
        - Light document editing (grammar, typos, etc.)
        - Understanding background information
        - Seeking alternative explanations for course material
    - **Submission of AI-generated text is prohibited**
    - Beyond light editing, all submitted text must be written by the student

**IMPORTANT:**
- Every submitted assignment/project must include a "Use Of GenAI" paragraph summarizing any GenAI usage
- Failure to include this paragraph or including untruthful statements will be considered a violation of academic integrity
- The course staff reserves the right to summon any student for an oral exam regarding any submitted work, and adjust the grade accordingly.  
    - The oral exam will focus on explaining your reasoning (no memorization required)
    - Students may be selected at random, not necessarily due to suspicion

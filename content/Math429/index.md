## Resources

LaTeX is a way to type up your assignment. If you decide to type up your assignments, I recommend you use LaTeX. There is a bit of a learning curve though. You may for example consider using OverleafLinks to an external site., or one of many other Tex editors including TeXstudioLinks to an external site.. If you use one of these to typeset your assignment, please submit your homework as a pdf. (Don't submit the .tex files)

The textbook is available open access at [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-41026-0) to an external site.. I personally suggest having a physical copy if possible.

If you want other linear algebra textbooks, Hoffmann and Kunze's Linear Algebra is a suggestion.

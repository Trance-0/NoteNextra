## Grounding DINO

[link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05499)

### Novelty in Grounding DINO

- Use CLIP to enhance the feature with DETER

1. Contrastive loss for text-region alignment
2. Localization loss-box regression (DINO style)
3. Auxiliary loss across decoder layers

Top 900 bounding boxes for inference.

> [!TIP]
>
> This paper shows a novel approach to open-vocabulary object detection by marrying DINO with CLIP. The authors use a DINO model to get the query features and then use a grounding head to get the bounding box and class label.
>
> I'm really interested in the number of bounding boxes for inference. I wonder how fine-grained the bounding boxes are? Does it serve a good reference for counting problems and doing logical reasoning for example the hand with 6 fingers?

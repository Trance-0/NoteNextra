This topic is mainly about Depth Estimation from Monocular Images. (Boring, not even RANSAC)

## PoseNet

A Convolutional Network for Real-Time 6-DOF Camera Relocalization (ICCV 2015)

Convolutional neural network (convnet) we train to estimate camera pose directly
from a monocular image, $I$. Our network outputs a pose
vector $p$, given by a 3D camera position $x$ and orientation
represented by quaternion q:

$$
p = [x, q]
$$

$q$ is a quaternion, $x$ is a 3D camera position.

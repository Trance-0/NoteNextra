> [!TIP]
>
> This is an interesting paper showing that it is possible to backdoor a diffusion model with high utility and high specificity at a low cost compared to per-training.
>
> I wonder how this technique could possibly be used for AI watermarking and reliably detected with other AI operations?
>
> And there are many metrics and loss functions used in this paper, I wonder what objectives they are trying to optimize, and looking for more clarification on the presentation.

## Novelty in Dual Semantic Guidance

Use dual semantic guidance for semantic segmentation. For each mask, deploy clip like object detection to align the mask with text description.

> This paper proposed a generalizable semantic segmentation model with a CLIP-like image-text encoder to refine the mask prediction.

In most cases, CLIP may not need complete image information to predict the object and can make a decision based on partial objects. If we have some novel objects containing features of two that might be out of CLIP's codebook, will the CLIP-alignment still work?

## InstructBLIP: Towards General-purpose Vision-Language Models with Instruction Tuning

[link to paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06500)

> [!TIP]
>
> This paper introduces InstructBLIP, a framework for a vision-language model that aligns with text instructions.
>
> It consists of three submodules: the BLIP-2 model with an image decoder, an LLM, and a query Transformer (Q-former) to bridge the two.
>
> From qualitative results, we can see some hints that the model is following the text instructions, but I wonder if this framework could also bring to the image editing and generation tasks? What might be the difficulties in migrating this framework to context-awarded image generation?

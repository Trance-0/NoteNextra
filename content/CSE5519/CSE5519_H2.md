> [!TIP]
>
> This paper is a good example revealing the data bias problem in computer vision. I was a bit shocked by the fact that the data is not proportional to the real world human distribution.
>
> I'm a bit curious about is there any "fair" dataset that is available to the general public today? What are the metrics used to evaluate the fairness of the dataset?

### Novelty in VGGT

Use alternating attention to encode the image.

> [!TIP]
>
>  VGGT uses a feed-forward neural network that directly infers all key 3D attributes of a scene using alternating attention and is robust to some non-rigid deformations.
> 
> I wonder how this model adapts to different light settings for the same image, how the non-Lambertian reflectance is captured, and how this framework can be extended to recover the true color of the objects and evaluate the surface properties of the objects.

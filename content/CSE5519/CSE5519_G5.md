- vanilla Droid-SLAM
- mono-depth initialization
- objective movement map prediction
- two-stage training scheme

> [!TIP]

> How does the two-stage training scheme help with the robustness of the model? For me, it seems that this paper is just the integration of GeoNet (separated pose and depth) with full regression.

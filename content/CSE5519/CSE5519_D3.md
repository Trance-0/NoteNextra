## Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers

Create a diffusion model with transformers.

Train conditional DiT models over latent patches replacing the U-Net.

> [!TIP]
>
> This paper provides a scalable way to integrate the conditional DiT models over latent patches, replacing the U-Net to improve the performance of image generation.
> 
> I wonder how classifier-free guidance is used in training the DiT and if the model also has in-context learning ability, as other transformer models do.

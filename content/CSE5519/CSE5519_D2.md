Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation using Textual Inversion

Goal: Enable language-guided generation of new, user-specific concepts.

### Novelty in Textual Inversion

Use pseudo-words that can guide generation.

Textual inversion:

$$
v_*=\arg\min_{v}\mathbb{E}_{z\sim \varepsilon(x),y,\epsilon\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1),t}\left[\|\epsilon-\epsilon_\theta(z_t,t,c_{\theta}(y))\|_2^2\right],
$$

$ means and how it is used to generate the new, user-specific concepts?

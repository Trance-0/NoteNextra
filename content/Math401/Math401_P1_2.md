# Math 401, Paper 1, Side note 2: Page's lemma

The page's lemma is a fundamental result in quantum information theory that provides a lower bound on the probability of error in a quantum channel.

## Statement

Choosing a random pure quantum state $\rho$ from the bi-partite pure state space $\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B$ with the uniform distribution, the expected entropy of the reduced state $\rho_A$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[H(\rho_A)]\geq \ln d_A -\frac{1}{2\ln 2} \frac{d_A}{d_B}
$$

## Page's conjecture

A quantum system $AB$ with the Hilbert space dimension $mn$ in a pure state $\rho_{AB}$ has entropy $0$ but the entropy of the reduced state $\rho_A$, assume $m\leq n$, then entropy of the two subsystem $A$ and $B$ is greater than $0$.

unless $A$ and $B$ are separable.

In the original paper, the entropy of the average state taken under the unitary invariant Haar measure is:

$$
S_{m,n}=\sum_{k=n+1}^{mn}\frac{1}{k}-\frac{m-1}{2n}
$$

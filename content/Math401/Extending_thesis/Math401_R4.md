# Math 401, Fall 2025: Thesis notes, R4, Superdense coding and Quantum error correcting codes

> Progress: 0/NaN=NaN% (denominator and enumerator may change)

This part may not be a part of "mathematical" research. But that's what I initially begin with.

## Superdense coding

> [!TIP]
>
> A helpful resource is [The Functional Analysis of Quantum Information Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.7188) Section 2.2
>
> Or another way in quantum computing [Quantum Computing and Quantum Information](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE#overview) Section 2.3

## Quantum error correcting codes

This part is intentionally left blank and may be filled near the end of the semester, by assignments given in CSE5313.
